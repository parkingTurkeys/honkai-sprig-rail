Note on SPD:

At the beginning of the battle, each unit's Action Value, representing the amount of time until that unit's next turn, is set to their Base Action Value.
At the beginning of the battle, effects that take effect upon entering battle, including SPD/AV modifying effects, are triggered on characters from left to right.
The unit with the lowest Action Value, i.e. shortest time until their next turn, is selected to be the next active unit.
All units subtract that lowest Action Value from their current Action Value, representing the progress of time until the next active unit's turn.
The active unit starts their turn. All DoTs on the active unit deal damage.
If the active unit is player-controlled and Auto mode is not enabled, the player has the opportunity to cast any pre-action Ultimate(s). Pre-action Ultimates cannot advance the action of the active unit (e.g. by the set effect of Eagle of Twilight Line), since at this point the active unit's Action Value is already zero.
The active unit acts, resetting their Action Value to their Base Action Value. The player can queue any post-action Ultimates during the action animation.
Any post-action Ultimates queued during the action animation execute. Post-action Ultimates can advance the next action of the active unit, since at this point its Action Value has been reset.
The active unit's turn ends, ticking down any Status Effects on the active unit. Some Status Effects only tick down if they were present at the beginning of the active unit's turn.
Repeat from #3.

Note on Shields:
If multiple shields are applied to the same character, they will not stack, and the effective shield value of the character is equal to that of the shield with the highest value. When taking DMG, all applied shields will absorb the full amount of DMG simultaneously. A lower-value shield can break in the background while a higher-value shield remains.
